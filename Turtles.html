<p> Turtles on the other hand are very interesting and are less likely to be pets inside your house. Although some people have turtles as pets, it is best to leave them outside in a bigger and more responsible place for them. Turtles can be fun to take pictures with, play with for a small period of time each day, and let it walk around but it is not the same unconditional love as a dog or cat. For instance, turtles need a lot of space to live and roam around. Turtles need roughly around 70-90 gallons of tank space and they live for an extremely long time because they are small and are protected. </p>

<p> Some kids might want a turtle to have as a pet for a few months or maybe a year, but unfortunately turtles can live up to decades and it will cost you a lot of money to keep the turtle with the proper equipment and the upkeep. Turtles can cost upwards of $1,200 at the beginning but a lot more after 20 years or more down the road. Another disadvantage of having a turtle as a pet for children is that they can carry salmonella which is not good for them. There are many steps in order to take care of a turtle. The first thing you have to consider is what type of turtle and the enviroment it will live in because both depend on each other and it makes a big impact if done right or wrong. The next step is to feed it the exact food they need to digest and stay healthy. </p>

<p> Turtles are labeled exotic so they shouldn't be roaming outside either. However, having a pet turtle has its advantages becasuse who wouldn't want to have a turtle living inside your room and wake up every morning by it. Some very common turtles as pets include the Red Eared Slider, African Sideneck Turtle, Eastern Box Turtle, Western Painted Turtle, Missisippi Map Turtle, and many more. If you do get a turtle for a pet, make sure to buy it from the pet store because if you don't it could carry a disease of any kind. Turtles can range from a few inches to over 4 feet depending on what type of turtle it is, unless it is a very rare species. </p>
