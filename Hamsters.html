<p> Hampsters are the next animal that are family friendly and are loved by everyone. Hampsters are a perfect family pet because of many reasons. The first reason is that they are very inexpesnive to buy. Hampsters can range fromn $10-$20 and their food is very cheap because they do not each or drink very much along with the food being bite size. Also, their cage that they live in is also very small and inexpensive and they also make no noise during the day or during the night. Hampsters also have little energy so you can hold them and carry them around and pet them without getting bit or chasing them around at all. During the day, they have the most energy so they will run on their wheel inside their cage and it is fun to watch them run as fast as they can. They are also very independent and do not require human attention 24/7 which is perfect when you leave the house and they can still stay in their cage without having to go outside to go to the bathroom. There are many types of hampsters such as Syrian Hampsters, Cambell's Hampsters, Robo Hampsters, Winter White Hampsters, and Chinese Hampsters. Syrian Hampsters are the biggest hampsters that can get up to 7 inches big and are the least friendly with other hampsters. Cambell's hampsters grow from 4-5 inches and are the most protective and nonturnal out of all the breeds. Robo hampsters are known as the dwarf hampsters and they only grow up to 2 inches and they are the fastest breed and love to excersise as much as they can. The Winter White Hampsters grow up to 4 inches and only come in two colors, brown or grey. This type of hampster is very energetic and likes to socialize. The last breed is the Chinese Hampster, they get up to 5 inches and they love to be by themselves because they are very shy. When held, the hampster will quietly sit and lay down. </p>
