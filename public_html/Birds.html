<p> Birds are the last animal that we will discuss and why they can make perfect pets at your house. The first reason why you should have a bird in your hosue is because they are super intelligent and actaully connect with seven year olds extremely well. Birds are one of the best animals to stay inside of their cage also because they don't have the need to go outside and it is perfect because you can leave without worrying about them. Birds can be very social with humans and connect and it is perfect for humans who like to pet birds and chill on their hand or shoulders. Birds are inexpesive because they have very cheap food and they don't mind living in small spaces, which is very convienent for humans because they will be in a small space and will not make alot of noise unless something is wrong. Also, birds have long life spans which is great so you don't need to get more birds every few years. Parakeets, Cockatiels, Canaries, Conures, and African Greys are the most popular house birds that are around and some of them can talk to humans which is pretty cool if you wanted them to repeat something back to you. Birds can be very friendly to humans if you give them the right place to live and they will be very social to everyone.
