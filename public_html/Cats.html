<p>Cats are also another animal that we will mention and talk about because can be just as fun to have as dogs and are very unique in its own ways. Most people will say that dogs are a better family pet than cats, but the cats may have better upsides than dogs in their own ways. One of the advantages of cats is that they take up very little space and never make any big messes that dogs usually do. Unlike dogs, cats can fall asleep in a small area and won't wake you up at night if they hear a noise downstairs. ALso unlike dogs, cats do not need to ever go outside and go to the bathroom or go on a walk. Cats can perfectly live inside without any trouble as long as they have a litter box, food, and water. This also allows cats to be a cheaper option. Cats are extremeley quiet animals and they will also cuddle with you at night when they get tired. Cats are stress free animals that can also give you love at night. Because cats do not require constant attention, they will stay out of trouble and they will never have people constantly wondering where they are and what they are doing. There are many types of cat breeds in the world, we will mention some breeds and the types of cats in it. Firstly, the cats with long hair are Persian, Maine Coon, Norwegian Forest, and Himalayan to name a few. The second type of breeds are the short haired cats and that includes Siamese, British Shorthair, American Shorthair, and The Sphynx, which is very unique and will stand out whenever you see a picture of it. There are many more breeds of cats in the world but these are some of the most dominant and well known. The most common kinds of cats in the United States is the Domestic Short Hairs, and those are over 90% of the cats owned.</p>
