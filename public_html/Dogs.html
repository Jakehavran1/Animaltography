<p> Dogs can be the shining light when you come home everyday, waiting by the door ready to play and fetch tennis balls. Their wagging tails show they are very affectionate with you and it is a great feeling. Many train their dogs so they will listen to every command and they are a great cuddle partner when you want them to be. Dogs can be inside and outside, or kenneled up when you leave the house, so they aren't a very big distraction. Dogs will get excited for everything that you want them to do and will hardly get tired when they are doing things all day long, which is very impressive. Dogs do not get enough credit because they can be very calm after they have just excersized for the last few hours and it is very soothing. Dogs are very underated because they always provide unconditional love, loyalty, and affection every single day. </p>

<p> There are many types of dogs and their behaviors that are very interesting and unique about them.  First, there are sporting dogs that go hunting, fishing, and are always running around and trying to get bunnies, squirrels, and birds. A few dogs in this group are Retrievers and Vizslas. Another breed of dogs are called the Hound Group. These dogs are similiar to the sporting dogs but not exactly, as these dogs have very fast speeds running, incredible stamina, and are very strong, but are not hunters and it would show when you see them in real life. The beagle and greyhound are two significant examples of this type of breed. The third breed is the toy group, and that consists of Maltese and Chinese Crested. These type of dogs are the ultimate lounge dogs that are usually laying around and showing their love to humans. The working group breed of dogs are known as the strongest dogs and also the hardest working as they work with the police and military. Some dogs in this class are Great Dane's and Boxers. The German and Austrialian Shepherd are in the herding group which specializes in controlling and managing how other animals move and in what direction. The last breed we will mention is the terrier group and that consists of the Bull Terrier and Boston Terrier. The terrier group specializes in guarding their property and also eating smalller animals such as rats and rodents. </p>
